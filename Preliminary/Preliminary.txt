Pseudocode:
1. Arguments to be passed to our program are friction coefficients, masses of blocks, array of forces and times correspondingly.
2. Based on the proposed solution different components for each block would be calculated according to passed inputs. 
3. Based on computed components the movement of bodies should be tracked in the given time period.

Potential Problems:
1. Incorrect solution of the problem.
2. Tracking the movement  of bodies for given time period.
